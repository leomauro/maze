Maze
====

I started on this little project as I was reviewing some work I had done on [another reinforcement learning project](https://github.com/rolyatmax/tictactoe). This project applies the same reinforcement learning (RL) concepts to maze learning as the solver attempts to find the shortest path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the maze.

While other algorithms will be much faster at solving static mazes, this solving algorithm is notable for how it stores its state. The solver's "knowledge" is represented by values associated with location-decision pairs.

For each location in the maze, there are one or more moves the solver can make to progress through the maze. After each move, the solver receives a reward (or in this case a punishment). Then, taking the reward into account along with the best move from the new location, the solver evaluates its last decision by updating its location-decision value.

For example, let's assume a solver which sits at **Location 1** and has two possible moves from that location: moves *a* and *b*. Let's say that after some learning, the solver has updated the relative values for these moves as such: *a* is -1 and *b* is 2. (Note: these values only mean that *b* is a better choice than *a*. One might also consider *how much better* a particular option is over another.) This policy recommends *b* as the best option for **Location 1**.

So the solver selects *b*, which let's say takes the solver to **Location 2**. From this location, let's say the solver has options *c* and *d* with respective values -5 and -10. Let's say the solver also, having made this move, receives a reward (or in this case a penalty) of -1. The solver can now evaluate its last decision with a function that takes into account the penalty (-1), the value of the last decision (2), and the best choice from the new location (-5). The result is that option *b* from **Location 1** will probably be downgraded somewhat from a value of 2 to something smaller.

The reason why a -1 is handed out as a penalty is to encourage the solver to find the fastest solution. Because there is a certain amount of "exploration" built into this solver, it will explore new areas of the maze if possible. This "exploration" factor decays over time to allow the solver to converge on a single solution. Currently, the solver is set to stop once it has arrived at the same conclusion several times in a row. If the maze were to change over time, however, one could have the exploration factor stay static to encourage the solver to continually explore the maze and adapt to changes.

One interesting aspect of this type of learning is that the values for each location-decision could be stored within each location. The evaluation function just needs to know what the best options are from the next location and resulting reward. This evaluation function could simply be passed to the solver as a callback to be executed once those values are known. Each location then essentially works as a guide to the solver, recommending directions and having the solver report back on the next step.

This type of "distributed" knowledge could work in routing systems where latency between nodes is variable and requires a routing policy that can constantly adapt to changes. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the policy might make it a good fit for emergent networks which have no governing controller.

Finally, I've tried to visualize the policy with the "Toggle policy values" button. This overlays the maze with transparent red squares. The transparency represents the value of each location's best move. The more opaque the red overlay, the higher the value. You can see locations near the end of the maze have the highest values.
